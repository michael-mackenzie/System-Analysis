# System Analysis

A small collection of questions from my system analysis course written in Matlab!

## Gram-Schmidt Procedure

This is a procedure for orthonormalizing a set of vectors in an inner product space.  Orthonormalization is the process of taking nonorthogonal linearly independent vectors and creating an orthogonal basis out of them.

## Project: Question 1

Question 1 deals with low-pass filters and noise removal from a signal.  In this case a butterworth filter was used.

## Project: Question 2

Question 2 deals with sampling and its mathematical properties within fourier transforms.
